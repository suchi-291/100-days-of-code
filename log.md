**Today's Progress**: Discovered The Odin project, Learned about the Javascript Engine and runtime, execution context, scoping chain, Hoisting and TDZ

**Thoughts:** 
1.I have understood that Javascript is JIT Compilation Language. The Browser contains Javascript engine, javascript runtime is like a container that has Javascript Engine and all the elements required like WebAPIS, Call back Queues.
2. The code written in Javascript is parsed into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Which then gets converted into machine language and gets executed in the call stack.
3. Before Execution execution contexts are generated, Global execution context gets created from the top level code and the functions get their own execution context.

Overall, for the first time I have understood regarding scoping, the global scope, the function scope, the block Scope. The hoisting of Function declarations , var variables, Let & Const Variables, Function expressions and Arrow Functions

I would want to revise these concepts everyday to expand my understanding in greater detail.

**Today's Progress**: Today has been the continuation of yesterday's FCC pyramid generator I have completed. I decided to bring in some changes and build a game out of it.

**Thoughts:** 
1. First of all, I have created, html, css along with js code. I have created events, created field for the user to give input.
2. changing the logic as per the choice user makes using radial buttons, outputting the pyramid on to Document properly all of these tasks took a lot of time for me. I did not know how to print the output exactly on to the document, took help of chat gpt over there.
3. Finally completed the game using space theme.

**Today's Progress**: I have worked on revising destructuring arrays, objects and looping over arrays and objects.
**Thoughts:** 
for..of loop is so cool, and being able to access every element of an array and object with out iteration feels very handy. To be able to apply everything I learn, I need to revisit all these topics every now and then.

**Today's Progress**: Solved CodeWars challenges, FCC gradeBook, Solved challenges related to Sets, maps


**Thoughts:** 
Thought of solving leetcode problems but the daily streak challenge required knowing DSA, I am from Non-CS/IT background so DSA feels very alien. I can see the difference in me, back then I hesitated to solve challenges because I couldnt understand the question at least. To me, being able to do this minimum is a reward. I am happy and I believe I will become a good developer soon. I have a phobia of forgetting everything I learnt so, from this week, I am planning on following a revision ritual every wednesday and sunday.
My TO DO list:
- [x] - practice CodeWars 1hr
- [x] - Solve FCC 2hr
- [x] - JS Udemy 4hr
- [x] - Research 30m
- [ ] - Odin project 30m 
      
Today I could not complete the Odin project, I have limited the time for it to 30mins, because I wanted to complete the Udemy course as fast as possible, to be able to start React, in future hopefully I will assign 1 to 2hr for the Odin project.

The problems I faced today, Somehow even though I was getting the output, FCC Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum I am facing issues while submitting, my code is not getting accepted, so I did not feel so much productive with FCC today.

I thought of solving leetcode problems in the beginning it was solvable but felt drawn to Codewars instead of leetCode, so there I lost 30mins to exploring how leetcode works

I have learnt a little bit of how to deploy code to git from VS Code. But I need to figure out how I can commit files to an already exisiting git repository

**Today's Progress**: Solved CodeWars challenges, FCC legacy JS DSA, Working with Strings


**Thoughts:** 
It's fun solving CodeWar problems, today went smooth, I have given most of the time to FCC Legacy Javascript and Algorithms ES6 chapter, I've encountered way more advanced topics which I have not yet covered in my Udemy Course.
My TO DO list:
- [x] - practice CodeWars 1hr
- [x] - Solve FCC 2hr
- [x] - JS Udemy 4hr
- [x] - Research 30m
- [ ] - Odin project 30m 
      
I figured out how to commit from VS code to existing repositories ðŸ¥³. I still have some time to complete set task for the Odin project, will update as soon as I cover it, if not It's going to be the first thing I shall be doing in the morning!

**Today's Progress**: Solved CodeWars challenges, Odin project CLI , Working with Strings


**Thoughts:** 
Today went into going through the unix shell documentation. I have leveled up to 7kyu in CodeWars ðŸ’ª. Worked with strings using string methods.
My TO DO list:
- [x] - practice CodeWars 1hr
- [ ] - Solve FCC 2hr
- [x] - JS Udemy 4hr
- [x] - Research 30m
- [x] - Odin project 30m 
      
I need to build stuff. I can't do it from scratch at the stage that I am in. I don't want to copy the code either.I have decided to watch a tutorial for just starting out but give my own touch to it and build it from scratch on my own.

**Today's Progress**: Solved CodeWars challenges, Revised everything


**Thoughts:** 
Today was revision ritual for me. I should become a lot better at coding, today I faced difficulty while solving codewar challenges, the idea was correct but it was the way of syntax that was wrong, it was the usage of truthy and falsy values.
My TO DO list:
- [x] - practice CodeWars 1hr
- [x] - Revision
