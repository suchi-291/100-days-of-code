**Today's Progress**: Discovered The Odin project, Learned about the Javascript Engine and runtime, execution context, scoping chain, Hoisting and TDZ

**Thoughts:** 
1.I have understood that Javascript is JIT Compilation Language. The Browser contains Javascript engine, javascript runtime is like a container that has Javascript Engine and all the elements required like WebAPIS, Call back Queues.
2. The code written in Javascript is parsed into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Which then gets converted into machine language and gets executed in the call stack.
3. Before Execution execution contexts are generated, Global execution context gets created from the top level code and the functions get their own execution context.

Overall, for the first time I have understood regarding scoping, the global scope, the function scope, the block Scope. The hoisting of Function declarations , var variables, Let & Const Variables, Function expressions and Arrow Functions

I would want to revise these concepts everyday to expand my understanding in greater detail.

**Today's Progress**: Today has been the continuation of yesterday's FCC pyramid generator I have completed. I decided to bring in some changes and build a game out of it.

**Thoughts:** 
1. First of all, I have created, html, css along with js code. I have created events, created field for the user to give input.
2. changing the logic as per the choice user makes using radial buttons, outputting the pyramid on to Document properly all of these tasks took a lot of time for me. I did not know how to print the output exactly on to the document, took help of chat gpt over there.
3. Finally completed the game using space theme.

**Today's Progress**: I have worked on revising destructuring arrays, objects and looping over arrays and objects.
**Thoughts:** 
for..of loop is so cool, and being able to access every element of an array and object with out iteration feels very handy. To be able to apply everything I learn, I need to revisit all these topics every now and then.

**Today's Progress**: Solved CodeWars challenges, FCC gradeBook, Solved challenges related to Sets, maps


**Thoughts:** 
Thought of solving leetcode problems but the daily streak challenge required knowing DSA, I am from Non-CS/IT background so DSA feels very alien. I can see the difference in me, back then I hesitated to solve challenges because I couldnt understand the question at least. To me, being able to do this minimum is a reward. I am happy and I believe I will become a good developer soon. I have a phobia of forgetting everything I learnt so, from this week, I am planning on following a revision ritual every wednesday and sunday.
My TO DO list:
- [x] - practice CodeWars 1hr
- [x] - Solve FCC 2hr
- [x] - JS Udemy 4hr
- [x] - Research 30m
- [ ] - Odin project 30m 
      
Today I could not complete the Odin project, I have limited the time for it to 30mins, because I wanted to complete the Udemy course as fast as possible, to be able to start React, in future hopefully I will assign 1 to 2hr for the Odin project.

The problems I faced today, Somehow even though I was getting the output, FCC Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum I am facing issues while submitting, my code is not getting accepted, so I did not feel so much productive with FCC today.

I thought of solving leetcode problems in the beginning it was solvable but felt drawn to Codewars instead of leetCode, so there I lost 30mins to exploring how leetcode works

I have learnt a little bit of how to deploy code to git from VS Code. But I need to figure out how I can commit files to an already exisiting git repository

**Today's Progress**: Solved CodeWars challenges, Revised everything


**Thoughts:** 
Today was revision ritual for me. I should become a lot better at coding, today I faced difficulty while solving codewar challenges, the idea was correct but it was the way of syntax that was wrong, it was the usage of truthy and falsy values.
My TO DO list:
- [x] - practice CodeWars 1hr
- [x] - Revision

**Today's Progress**: Solved CodeWars challenges, Revised everything, Completed first project from TOP, Halfway through functions.

**Thoughts:** 
Yesterday, I was doubting myself. Then I got to watch a cool youtube video. And my spirit is back, I understood I need to keep my expectations humble.Today I tried solving higher kyu levels in codewars, I could'nt solve them, may be I would have if I sat on them for long, but I had other things I needed to do, so could give it only 3 hours of time, even though my first intention was to put in 1 hour. I have broke something I guess, after setting up git in my VM, I cant do commits from Vs code on my windows. So I'm having to do everythingon Linux and use git commands while do, It's a good thing actually.

My TO DO list:
- [x] - practice CodeWars 1hr
- [ ] - Solve FCC 2hr
- [x] - JS Udemy 4hr

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed CSS foundations on the Odin Project

**Thoughts:** 
I can feel the despair kicking in, this is like second time in a week I skipped a day. Today I actually want to build projects along with the course that I am working on. Still I have this feeling of inadequacy if I'm only working on the udemy course. So I have decided to cover the odin foundations js as well, because if the way the curriculum was designed. Too many things on my plate at a time, burn't me out, so I'll be flexible and take things slowly, step by step.

**Today's Progress**: Today was spent on the Odin project.

**Thoughts:** 
Today was spent on building landing page, it was entirely with the help of flexbox, I can see the difference in how I was able to do with ease compared to the times before. Looking at an image I was able to take decisions and plan the page, and build it without much friction.
