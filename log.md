# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 08, 2024 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Discovered The Odin project, Learned about the Javascript Engine and runtime, execution context, scoping chain, Hoisting and TDZ

**Thoughts:** 
1.I have understood that Javascript is JIT Compilation Language. The Browser contains Javascript engine, javascript runtime is like a container that has Javascript Engine and all the elements required like WebAPIS, Call back Queues.
2. The code written in Javascript is parsed into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Which then gets converted into machine language and gets executed in the call stack.
3. Before Execution execution contexts are generated, Global execution context gets created from the top level code and the functions get their own execution context.

Overall, for the first time I have understood regarding scoping, the global scope, the function scope, the block Scope. The hoisting of Function declarations , var variables, Let & Const Variables, Function expressions and Arrow Functions

I would want to revise these concepts everyday to expand my understanding in greater detail.
