**Today's Progress**: Discovered The Odin project, Learned about the Javascript Engine and runtime, execution context, scoping chain, Hoisting and TDZ

**Thoughts:** 
1.I have understood that Javascript is JIT Compilation Language. The Browser contains Javascript engine, javascript runtime is like a container that has Javascript Engine and all the elements required like WebAPIS, Call back Queues.
2. The code written in Javascript is parsed into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Which then gets converted into machine language and gets executed in the call stack.
3. Before Execution execution contexts are generated, Global execution context gets created from the top level code and the functions get their own execution context.

Overall, for the first time I have understood regarding scoping, the global scope, the function scope, the block Scope. The hoisting of Function declarations , var variables, Let & Const Variables, Function expressions and Arrow Functions

I would want to revise these concepts everyday to expand my understanding in greater detail.

**Today's Progress**: Today has been the continuation of yesterday's FCC pyramid generator I have completed. I decided to bring in some changes and build a game out of it.
**Thoughts:** 
1. First of all, I have created, html, css along with js code. I have created events, created field for the user to give input.
2. changing the logic as per the choice user makes using radial buttons, outputting the pyramid on to Document properly all of these tasks took a lot of time for me. I did not know how to print the output exactly on to the document, took help of chat gpt over there.
3. Finally completed the game using space theme.

**Today's Progress**: I have worked on revising destructuring arrays, objects and looping over arrays and objects.
**Thoughts:** 
for..of loop is so cool, and being able to access every element of an array and object with out iteration feels very handy. To be able to apply everything I learn, I need to revisit all these topics every now and then.
