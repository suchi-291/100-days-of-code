# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

I have seen people code every day and complete the challenge. This challenge helps me feel accountable and not lose track of my progress.

As per the challenge, I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.

Iâ€™ve decided to make this a public commitment.

And you should join me too. Please visit [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) Official Website for more information about the challenge
